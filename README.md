# Welcome!

My name is Grzegorz, and I'm an aspiring frontend developer from Poland. I don't have many projects here, as I think some of them are not worth publishing, however, I'm looking forward to making awesome stuff in the future. My work is focused on ski jumping and [JBwA community](https://www.miejski.pl/slowo-Jebawka).

You can find my summary on my [website](https://mensix.xyz/).
