# Welcome!

My name is Grzegorz. I am frontend developer based in Poland. I am currently working as a Frontend Developer at [mTap Smart City](mtapsmartcity.com), meanwhile I am a proud Computer Science student at [Warsaw University of Life Sciences](https://wzim.sggw.edu.pl) where I gain more and more knowledge. Besides that, I have been working on such widespreadly mentioned projects as [dsj24](https://dsj24.pl) and [Bazarek Wyborczy](https://bazarekwyborczy.pl). Here I publish some of my projects I considered to be worth uploading, therefore feel free to look at them!
