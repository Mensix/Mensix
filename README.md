# Welcome!

My name is Grzegorz, and I'm aspiring frontend developer from Poland. I don't have many projects here, as I think some of them are not worth publishing, however, I'm looking forward for making awesome stuff in future. My work is focused around ski jumping and [JBwA community](https://www.miejski.pl/slowo-Jebawka).
