# Welcome!

Feeling a bit too lazy to write README by myself, so...

Hello there! I'm Grzegorz, a 21-year-old frontend developer from Poland. Currently, I hold a Frontend Developer position primarily at TechOcean, but I also contribute to projects at mTap Smart City. Additionally, I am a Computer Science student at Warsaw University of Life Sciences, where I have gained many important IT and math skills. Since November 2023, I have held the vice-chairman position at Silver.NET scientific circle, which includes top programming students. In this role, I conduct lectures for interested students and manage current affairs.

My primary skills include Nuxt, Vue, TailwindCSS, and to a lesser extent, C#.

Some of the projects I am most proud of include:
- [Sekcje](https://sekcje.github.io/): A list of Facebook groups belonging to one of the most popular Polish subcommunities in the country's social media. (Tech stack: Vue, Nuxt, Quasar, Firebase)
- [DSJ24](https://dsj24.pl/): A list of venues for Deluxe Ski Jump 4 game, which gained widespread media coverage due to the game's popularity in Poland. (Tech stack: Vue, Nuxt, BootstrapVue)

One might wonder why I used CSS frameworks for these projects. Well, the first was written in 2019, and the second in 2020. I was still inexperienced at that time! Over the following years, I worked on smaller, yet community-oriented projects, which you can explore in my profile.

Currently, I am working on WULS Plan, a college project that allows planners to create lesson plans for students in an easy and intuitive way, eliminating the need for extensive Excel spreadsheets. Check out the repository: [WULS Plan](https://github.com/SilverNETGroupSGGW/plansggw)
